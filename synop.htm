      <p>30 years ago, a son of a wealthy family, Chou Puyuan, had an affair with 
        the family maid, Shi Ping, and she gave birth of two sons. In the night 
        before New Year, after Chou Puyan chose to marry a wealthy woman Fan Yi, 
        his family kept the eldest son Chou Ping and he drove Shi Ping out from 
        his with the younger dying son Dahai. </p>
      <p>Chou Puyuan became an autocratic and cold-blooded owner of his coal mines 
        and was living in Tianjin when he finished his study in Germany. Chou 
        Puyuan and Fan Yi had their youngest son Chou Chung and later brought 
        the eldest son Chou Ping to the family for reunion. Shi Ping, having been 
        saved from the attempt of suicide and experienced bitter marriage again, 
        married a butler, Lu Kuei, and they had a daughter, Si Feng. Fan Yi couldn't 
        tolerate the patriarchy in the family and fell in love with Chou Ping 
        secretly, while the latter was in secret love with servant Si Feng. But 
        Chou Chung also loved Si Feng.</p>
      <p>In a day before thunderstorm of summer, Shi Ping came from a distant 
        city to see her daughter Si Feng, Fan Yi asked her to have a talk about 
        dismissing Si Feng from her servant work. Accompaning Shi Ping's visit 
        to Chou's house, Da Hai, now a miner and representative of labor union 
        came to fight with his father Zhou Puyuan, who he had no clue on connection 
        to the family. When she met Chou Puyuan again Shi Ping realized that she 
        had come to a family where she had been driven out. Chou Ping stroke Da 
        Hai for his straight pinpoints of the money-grabbed Chou Puyuan's bloody 
        threat to the miners and the trick in destroying the union. </p>
      <p>When Fan Yi, the stepmother, was convinced that Chou Ping would elope 
        with Si Feng despite of her pleading to take her as well, her mind was 
        bent on revenge, In a fit of hysteria, she revealed Shi Ping, Si Feng 
        and her son Chou Chung that she had been Ping's mistress. When her son 
        Chou Chung did not follow her to be fanned jealousy into heart to blame 
        Ping and Feng. In last struggle, Fan Yi took Chou Puyuan down to stop 
        the elopement. Yet all her calculation came to no avail. Chou Puyuan came 
        down only to uncover the true identities of all the families on the spot,</p>
      <p>Soon the whole family was destroyed by despair. When Si Feng realized 
        Chou Ping was actually her brother and was unable to bear the shame, she 
        committed suicide in a night of thunderstorm. Chou Chong was also electrocuted 
        in an attempt to save her. At the sight of this calamity, Fan Yi, who 
        had not until now realized that her vengeful scheme would participate 
        a tragedy far grimmer than her own, asked Chou Ping's forgiveness. But 
        Ping shot himself to death in his room. Shi Ping and Fan Yi went mad after 
        a great shock, Da ning that Chou Puyuan is none other than his father, 
        left the house without returning. Chou Puyuan was left all to himself, 
        an empty house and two mad ladies, to pass his days with a penitent memory,<br>
