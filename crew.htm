      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">This is my third time as a stage manager, but in 
        Oxford, it is my first play. This production&nbsp;is quite of a&nbsp;challenge 
        to me, as being in Oxford for only a term so far, i've not yet build up 
        any contacts, whereas back in Singapore, having acted and worked in&nbsp;productions&nbsp;for 
        several years, things were definitely much easier. I hope that this play 
        will be a success, and all goes well</font></p>

        with Hui Ming on backstage. I joined initially&nbsp;out of curiosity... 
        and I am glad that this is turning out to be lot of fun... can't wait

      <p>At Oxford he has appeared in Honk! (OFS), produced the Bald Prima Donna

        Education Officer for OUDS last year and has just had a touring production 
        to Cherwell School recently.&nbsp; He loves life without stage though
