      <p>This play's publicity bills it as 'The Chinese answer to Shakespeare'. 
        The comparison is not unreasonable but the feel was rather more akin to 
        Greek tragedy, with its tone of formal high drama and themes of forbidden 
        love and nature itself reacting against unnatural acts. The tale takes place 
        in the house of a mining magnate, Chou Pu Yuan, and his family, divided 
        by their secrets and aspirations. Waiting on them are two servants, Lu 
        Kei and his pretty young daughter Ssu-Feng, who, along with the rest of their 
        family, are to play central roles in the ensuing revelations. As a thunderstorm 
        builds outside, tensions rise within.</p>
      <p>A convenient diagram is provided in the programme, both clarifying the 
        relationships between the protagonists and cleverly hinting at the revelations 
        to come. The acting was universally strong, though the cast had some difficulty 
        building a tense, claustrophobic atmosphere in the large and airy venue. 
        Carly Vanderburg and Thomas Williams as the master's dissatisfied young 
        wife and her fraught, self-loathing step-son both gave appropriately highly-strung 
        performances from the outset, but this left them little room for maneuver 
        as feelings mounted higher. More successful were co-director Wen Tak Wong's 
        quietly domineering performance as the master of the house, and producer 
        Siran Lu's playing of the young serving girl Ssu-Feng, torn between her 
        desires and her duty. Their mannered styles gave them more scope to raise 
        the emotional tone as the play progressed, without slipping into melodrama.</p>
      <p>The staging was excellent, with some gorgeous Chinese costumes and make-up, 
        spare but well-designed sets and good use of sound to heighten the stormy 
        atmosphere. This production is clearly a labour of love for those involved, 
        so it is heartening to see it so successfully realised. An unusual modern 
        tragedy that is well worth a visit.</p>
