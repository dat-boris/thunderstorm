      <p>The Thunderstorm is a play of tensions, and, in the twenty-four hours 
        in which the action takes place, we watch these tensions mount and tauten 
        as the tragic climax swiftly approached. The setting is the home of an 
        industrialist in north China, where a family has come together with the 
        inexorable fatality of a Greek drama.<br>
        <br>
        Here, in miniature, we witness the disintegration of the fabric of the 
        old society and the birth pangs of the new. The head of the house, a self-made 
        man whose preoccupation with success has made him in sensible to the ties 
        of blood and affection, still bears within him the stifling weight of 
        the old feudal society. The younger generation is in rebellion against 
        the decaying order, which the older generation stand for, and the intensity 
        of their reaction reveals new facets in the dramatic situation. <br>
        <br>
        The play is an accomplished example of the Western form of drama in China. 
        The emotional conflicts and stresses should be handled with such finesse 
        and skillfully interwoven and counterpoised in such a way that suspense 
        is sustained to the final curtain.<br>
        <br>
        With its touch of the most sensitive social issues, it showed the greatest 
        social concern for the plight of the workers under capitalist exploitation 
        and an individual effort to assert personal freedom and happiness under 
        the weight of patriarchal society. It is so ruthless in its attacks upon 
        traditional Chinese morals and measures of family value. </p>
      <p>Greatest artistic flaw tragedy must be more than an abject expression 
        of despair or admission of failure.</p>
      <p>This play will be a fusion of cultures, of arts, of people and of tragedy 
        and exhilaration. This is an ambitious attempt to perform a Chinese Modern 
        Drama as much authentic flavor as possible, with a cast consisting of 
        both western and eastern origins. It will be a play of elaborate costumes 
        with minimal settings and props. With a team of experienced stage makers, 
        this play will indeed be a spectacular exhibition in a mix of eastern 
        and western setting.</p>
