        Thunderstorm is an outstanding example of the modern Chinese play. Published 
        when the author was only twenty, this play took the literary world by 
        storm. Tsao Yu's four classic works, &lt;Thunderstorm&gt;, &lt;Sunrise&gt;, 
        &lt;The wildness &gt;, &lt;Bei Jing People&gt;, have been performed on 
        thousands of stages and under a multiplicity of guises, bringing enthusiasm 
        and appreciation for the Chinese play up to an all-time high.</p>
      <p>The story of 'Thunderstorm' unravels within a single day, but past events 
        soon catch up with the eight characters in the large Chinese capitalist 
        family. The story steadily reveals paradoxes arising from conflicting 
        moral values and class differences, with certain characters seeking to 
        rebel against the conventions of society. Passion and vigour are combined 
        with an initially invisible yet increasingly perceptible feeling of a 
        looming tragedy, culminating in a colossal thunderstorm. A tale which 
        has shaken every audience, its impact reverberating in their <br>
        minds and hearts. </p>
      <p>This play is an outstanding example of the modern Chinese play. The story 
        takes place within a large capitalist family in China. Through a conflict 
        between two generations, it reveals the darker side of human nature and 
        society. A tale of intrigue and passion, rife with paradoxes - Tsao Yu's 
        most famous work is simply unmissable.</p>
